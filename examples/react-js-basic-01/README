Goal:

Basic skeleton react js application without `create-react-app`.


TLDR;

yarn init -y
yarn add react react-dom
yarn add -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-react
yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli

Then create entry file src/index.js

At this point, we can bundle if src/index.js not contains JSX.

We have to tell webpack to use loader that is able to parse JSX, which is,
provided by babel-loader via @babel/preset-react.

First, at least we have to make babel config file in .babelrc.

Contents of .babelrc, at minimum is:

{ "presets": ["@babel/preset-react"] }


Then, at this point, we can do:

  npx webpack -p --module-bind "js=babel-loader"


To save typing webpack module-bind every time, we can make it stick with config
file (by default webpack will search webpack.config.js)

  npx webpack -p  # for production build
  npx webpack -d  # for devel build
